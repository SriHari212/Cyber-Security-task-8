`VPN` `Privacy` `Cybersecurity` `Hands-On Project` `Networking`

## 1. Project Overview

This project documents a hands-on investigation into the functionality, benefits, and real-world limitations of using a commercial Virtual Private Network (VPN). The objective was to move beyond theoretical knowledge and gain practical experience by setting up, using, and evaluating a VPN service on a personal device. The entire process was conducted from my location in Chennai, India.

## 2. Methodology & Steps Followed

The project was executed following a structured, step-by-step approach:

1.  **Selection:** Chose a reputable VPN provider with a functional free tier (ProtonVPN) to ensure a safe and accessible testing environment.
2.  **Installation & Setup:** Downloaded the official VPN client from the app store onto a mobile device and completed the account creation and login process.
3.  **Connection:** Established an encrypted connection to a remote VPN server located in a different country (the Netherlands).
4.  **Verification:** Used an online IP-checking tool (`whatismyipaddress.com`) to confirm that my public IP address and digital location were successfully masked.
5.  **Usage Test:** Conducted a real-world usage test by browsing websites, using social media apps, and connecting to a public Wi-Fi network to assess functionality and the user experience.
6.  **Performance Analysis:** Ran comparative speed tests (`speedtest.net`) with the VPN connected and disconnected to quantify the impact on internet performance.
7.  **Summary & Report:** Documented the findings, including both the qualitative feedback and quantitative data, to form a comprehensive conclusion.

## 4. Key Findings and Observations

### Confirmed Benefits:

* **Effective IP Masking:** The VPN was 100% effective at masking my real IP address. My digital location instantly changed from Chennai, India, to that of the remote server, confirming its primary privacy function.
* **Tangible Security on Public Wi-Fi:** When connected to an unsecured public network, the active VPN provided a clear sense of security. Knowing the traffic was encrypted made me confident in performing tasks I would otherwise avoid on such networks.
* **Access to Geo-Restricted Content:** The VPN demonstrated the ability to bypass basic geo-blocks, presenting my traffic as originating from Europe.

### Identified Limitations:

* **Significant Performance Impact:** The most notable trade-off was a severe reduction in internet speed. My connection speed dropped by over 60% while connected to the distant server, a direct result of encryption overhead and increased data travel distance (latency).
* **The Critical Element of Trust:** The experience highlighted that using a VPN shifts trust from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to the VPN provider. This underscores the absolute necessity of choosing a service with a proven and audited **no-logs policy**.
* **Free Tier Restrictions:** The free version, while functional for this test, came with clear limitations, including a restricted number of server locations and potentially slower speeds compared to paid plans.

## 5. Conclusion

This practical exercise successfully demystified VPN technology. It proved that a reputable VPN is a highly effective and accessible tool for enhancing personal privacy and securing data on untrusted networks.

However, it is not a magic bullet. The trade-off between security and speed is significant, and the entire model hinges on the trustworthiness of the VPN provider. A VPN is a powerful asset for specific security and privacy needs, but understanding its limitations is crucial for its effective and safe use.
